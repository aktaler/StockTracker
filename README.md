## Background
I am a currently a Java developer with a couple of years of experience in the industry, I also got a background in robotics and industry automation. I decided to create this project to expand my skills and knowledge by diving into Go and htmx.

## Project Description
This application was created with the purpose of teaching myself how to use Go and htmx together. It serves as a practical way for me to explore these technologies and understand their functionalities. The main focus of this project is to create an interactive stock tracker that allows users to keep track of their stock portfolio and get real-time updates on the value of their stocks using htmx.

## Functionality
The application allows users to:

* Sign up for an account and create a portfolio of stocks
* View the current value of their stocks in real-time using htmx
* Edit their portfolio by adding or removing stocks
* View a list of all the stocks in their portfolio at any time

This project is a great way for me to learn about Go and htmx, and I hope it can be a useful resource for others who are looking to learn these technologies as well.
